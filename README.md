# Data Science Agent Project

## Overview

The Data Science Agent Project is designed to develop automated problem identification systems that detect and resolve operational issues in real-time. The project involves designing and implementing end-to-end data science pipelines for large-scale data processing, leveraging advanced AI models like LLaMA2 for generating insights, and performing image interpretation using Lava.

## Key Features

- **Automated Problem Identification**: Systems designed to detect and resolve operational issues automatically.
- **End-to-End Data Science Pipelines**: Complete pipelines for large-scale data processing, from data collection to model deployment.
- **Business Insights Generation**: Utilization of LLaMA2 for generating actionable business insights and summarizing complex documents.
- **Image Interpretation**: Accurate visual data insights delivered through image interpretation using Lava.
- **Query-Based QA Systems**: General query-based systems to enhance information retrieval and provide users with relevant answers.
- **Web Application Development**: Creation and deployment of Django-based APIs and web applications integrated with MySQL for data management.

## Technologies Used
