The readings are recorded every 15 minutes, with a total of 260 observations.\n\nThe dataset shows a wide range of blood glucose levels, with the highest reading reaching 154.116940 mg/dL at 8:00 AM, and the lowest reading reaching 79.726750 mg/dL at 7:55 AM. The average blood glucose level over the 10-hour period is 101.278428 mg/dL.\n\nThe CGM readings show a similar range, with the highest reading reaching 155.226440 mg/dL at 8:00 AM, and the lowest reading reaching 73.110747 mg/dL at 7:55 AM. The average CGM level over the 10-hour period is"
